Subject: [PATCH] dracut-functions.sh: Avoid loading unnecessary 32-bit
 libraries for 64-bit initrds

Due to the 'inst_libdir_file "libnss_files*"' in the udev-rules module
this caues the /usr/lib/libnss_files-2.18.so* to be included. This is a
32-bit library and pulls in a 32-bit version of glibc also even on a
64-bit system.

This is due to the fact that ldconfig -pN will print [/usr]/lib paths
from the cache as well as [/usr]/lib64. As we handle these paths
specifically we should ignore these results from the cache.

Also there was a missing space when appending the ldconfig paths
onto our list meaning the last builtin and first ldconfig path
were unusable.
